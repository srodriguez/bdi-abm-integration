	 * /doc-files/WKT.html To get the correct wkt string for a region in

	 * Note, VIC straddles two zones 54H and 55H.
	 * 
	 * It is crucial when combining GIS data from multiple sources that they use
	 * the same projection.

         * For OSM recommendation on Australian defaults see:
         * https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/OSM_tags_for_routing/Maxspeed#Australia
         * Values pasted below:
         * highway=motorway - 100 km/h usually, 110 km/h only where sign-posted
         * highway=primary - 80 to 90 km/h
         * highway=secondary - 50 to 70 km/h
         * highway=tertiary - 50 km/h
         * highway=residential - 50 km/h, usually 40 km/h in school zones
         *
         * Also the OSM tagging guidelines for Australia
         * https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Australian_Tagging_Guidelines#Regional_Roads say:
         *
         * Regional Roads
         * highway=motorway Motorways, freeways, and freeway-like roads.
         *      Divided roads with 2 or 3 lanes in each direction, limited access via interchanges, no traffic lights.
         *      Generally 100 or 110 km/h speed limit. For example: Hume Freeway. In states with the Alphanumeric
         *      system, these are 'M' roads if they are of freeway standard.
         * highway=trunk National highways connecting major population centres.
         *      For example the Bruce Highway north of Cooroy. State strategic road network for example:
         *      Pacific Highway. In states with the Alphanumeric system, these are 'A' roads. 'M' roads which aren't
         *      of freeway standard are also classified as a trunk road. In other states, these are signposted with
         *      a white National Road shield, or a Green National Highway shield.
         * highway=primary State maintained roads linking major population centers to each other and to
         *      the trunk network. In states with the Alphanumeric system, these are 'B' roads. In other states,
         *      these are generally State routes signposted with blue shields.
         * highway=secondary District roads that are generally council maintained roads linking smaller population
         *      centres to each other and to the primary network. In states with the Alphanumeric system,
         *      these are 'C' roads.
         * highway=tertiary Other roads linking towns, villages and Points of Interest to each other and the
         *      secondary network. In South Australia, roads that are classified as a 'D' route under the
         *      Alphanumeric system use this classification.
         * highway=residential Local streets found in and around cities, suburbs and towns as well as in rural areas.
         * highway=unclassified Other named minor roads.
         * highway=track Gravel fire trails, forest drives, 4WD trails and similar roads. Gravel roads connecting
         *      towns etc. should be tagged as appropriate (secondary, tertiary or unclassified), along with
         *      the 'surface=unpaved' tag.
         * highway=service Unnamed access roads. e.g. Entranceways and roads in parks, government properties,
         *      beach access etc. Use a short service road where you may want to mark the entrance to a
         *      private/government area, but not map the interior private roads in detail.
         * Use the surface=unpaved tag to indicate where roads are not sealed.
         * Use the ref=* tag to indicate a route number that is signposted according to the standard below, or
         *      use a route relation. Omit non-signposted, anachronistic or historical route numbers.
         * highway=safe_t_cam Use this tag to mark the position of the NSW and SA Safe - T - Cam system
         *
         * Urban Areas
         * highway=motorway The metropolitan motorway network. 'M' classified roads in cities where they exist.
         * highway=trunk "Metroads" or 'A' classified roads in the cities where they exist, or other similar
         *      cross-city trunk routes in cities where they do not.
         * highway=primary Other main cross city and arterial routes. 'B' classified roads in cities
         *      where they exist. Major connecting roads in larger rural cities.
         * highway=secondary Major through routes within a local area, often connecting neighbouring suburbs.
         * highway=tertiary Minor through routes within a local area, often feeders to residential streets.
         * highway=residential Residential streets.
         * highway=unclassified Other streets. Not generally through routes.
         * highway=service Un-named service and access roads. Also used for small named rear-access lanes.
